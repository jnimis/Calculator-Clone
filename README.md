Notes:

- restricted to iPhone devices (not iPad) and portrait mode - tested on virtual iPhone 8, iPhone 11 Max, and my personal iPhone SE
- I'm a little embarrassed to have all the business logic in ViewController.swift, after our conversation about architecture, but building more classes felt overly complicated for this task
- I didn't build any unit tests, but would have done so if the math needs were more robust
